The Accelerated Reionization Era Simulations (ARES) code was designed to
rapidly generate models for the global 21-cm signal. It can also be used as a 
1-D radiative transfer code, stand-alone non-equilibrium chemistry solver, or
global radiation background calculator.

A few papers on how it works:

- 1-D radiative transfer: `Mirocha et al. (2012) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...756...94M>`_.
- Uniform backgrounds \& global 21-cm signal: `Mirocha (2014) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.443.1211M>`_.
- Parameter inference: `Mirocha, Harker, & Burns (2015) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813...11M>`_.
- Galaxy luminosity functions: `Mirocha, Furlanetto, & Sun (2016) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160700386M>`_.

Be warned: this code is still under active development -- use at your own
risk! Correctness of results is not guaranteed.

If you'd like to live on the bleeding edge, check out the ares-dev branch! Once you clone *ares* you can switch via: ::
    
    hg up ares-dev

The `documentation <http://ares.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ are still a work in progress.

Citation
--------
If you use ARES in paper please reference `Mirocha (2014) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.443.1211M>`_ if its an application of the global 21-cm modeling machinery and `Mirocha et al. (2012) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...756...94M>`_ if you use the 1-D radiative transfer and/or SED optimization. Either way, please provide a link to `this page <https://bitbucket.org/mirochaj/ares>`_ as a footnote.

Getting started
---------------------
To clone a copy and install: ::

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/mirochaj/ares ares
    cd ares
    python setup.py install

You'll need to set an environment variable which points to the *ares* install directory, e.g. (in bash) ::

    export ARES=/users/<yourusername>/ares

*ares* will look in ``$ARES/input`` for lookup tables of various kinds. To download said lookup tables, run ::

    python remote.py
    
This might take a few minutes. If something goes wrong with the download, you can run    ::

    python remote.py fresh
    
to get fresh copies of everything.
    
Dependencies
--------------------
You will need:

- `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
- `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
- `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_

and optionally,

- `hmf <https://github.com/steven-murray/hmf>`_
- `h5py <http://www.h5py.org/>`_
- `mpi4py <http://mpi4py.scipy.org>`_
- `emcee <http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/>`_
- `distpy <https://bitbucket.org/ktausch/distpy>`_
- `progressbar2 <http://progressbar-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
- `setuptools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_
- `mpmath <http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn-history/r1229/trunk/doc/build/setup.html>`_
- `shapely <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely>`_
- `descartes <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/descartes>`_

Quick Example
--------------
To generate a model for the global 21-cm signal, simply type: ::

    import ares
    
    sim = ares.simulations.Global21cm()      # Initialize a simulation object
    sim.run()                                                  
    
You can examine the contents of ``sim.history``, a dictionary which contains 
the redshift evolution of all IGM physical quantities, or use some built-in 
analysis routines: ::

    sim.GlobalSignature()
    
If the plot doesn't appear automatically, set ``interactive: True`` in your matplotlibrc file or type: ::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
    pl.show()

See the documentation for more examples.

Documentation
--------------
To generate the documentation locally, ::

    cd $ARES/doc
    make html
    open _build/html/index.html
    
This will open the documentation in a browser. For the above to work, you'll
need `sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/contents.html>`_, which can be installed
via pip: ::

    pip install sphinx

This depends on `numpydoc <https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc>`_, which can also
be installed via pip: ::

    pip install numpydoc

You can also just view the latest build `here <http://ares.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

Help
----
If you encounter problems with installation or running simple scripts, first check the Troubleshooting page in the documentation to see if you're dealing with a common problem. If you don't find your problem listed there, please let me know!
