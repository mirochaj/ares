Black Hole Sources
==================
Black hole sources currently have a wider array of potential behaviors than 
stellar sources. For example, their spectra can be quite a bit more complicated.
*ares* supports several standard SEDs for BHs:

* Power-law (see ``source_alpha`` parameter to set slope)
* Absorbed power-law (see ``source_logN`` to set absorbing column)
* The multi-color disk spectrum

BHs are also normalized differently.
