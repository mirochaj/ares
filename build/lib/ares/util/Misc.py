def get_hash(repo_path=None, repo_env='ARES'):
    """
    Return the unique git hash associated with the HEAD of some repository.

    This intended to be used to save the current version of some code you're
    using with any output files to help with debugging later. For example,
    I have some output files for a calculation I've done that change over time,
    indicating a problem/development, and I want to know precisely when that
    change happened. In practice, I usually save the output of this function
    as metadata in an hdf5 file (e.g., as an attribute of some dataset or
    as a dataset of its own).

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo_path : str, None
        Absolute path to root directory of repo of interest (where .git lives)
    repo_env : str, None
        Name of environment variable that points to repo (again, the root
        directory where .git lives).

    Returns
    -------
    A string containing the unique hash of the current HEAD of git repo.

    Known Flaws
    -----------
    If you run your code with uncommitted changes, then this hash may not help
    you find a bug, as the bug could have been in your uncommitted changes.
    There's not really a good solution to this, other than to always run your
    code with a 'clean' install!
